## Traffic Volume Prediction

<p align='justify'>
In this project, we address the complex task of predicting traffic volumes by integrating a range of machine learning models with thorough data analysis techniques. The process begins with loading key datasets, namely traffic.csv and weather.csv, to establish a foundational understanding of how traffic patterns correlate with various weather conditions.

A significant phase of our investigation involved applying seasonal decomposition to the traffic data. This technique was pivotal in identifying and understanding the cyclical trends and seasonality inherent in traffic patterns. The insights gained from this decomposition were instrumental in enhancing our data analysis, particularly in the realm of feature engineering, where we developed targeted variables to augment the predictive accuracy of our models.

Our choice of models, including LightGBM, XGBoost, and CatBoost, was deliberate and strategic. Each model underwent meticulous tuning and testing to optimize performance and predictive capabilities. Our approach extended beyond model development; we conducted extensive evaluations, experimenting with diverse combinations of features and model parameters to refine our predictions.

The culmination of this notebook is not merely a set of predictive models but a comprehensive analysis that elucidates the various factors influencing traffic volumes. This work lays a solid foundation for further research and development in this field, providing a roadmap for subsequent analysts to refine and expand upon. Future directions could include deeper exploration into feature engineering or a more detailed examination of how specific weather conditions impact traffic flow.

This project exemplifies the application of data science in addressing practical, real-world challenges, offering valuable insights for professionals in fields such as urban planning and traffic management.
