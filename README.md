## Traffic Volume Prediction
In this project we jump into the intriguing challenge of forecasting traffic flow using a blend of machine learning models and insightful data analysis. Our journey starts with the basics â€“ loading datasets like traffic.csv and weather.csv to weave together a story of how traffic patterns intertwine with weather conditions. We then take a dive into the data, where we meticulously clean and preprocess it, ensuring it's just right for analysis.

A key step in our exploration is seasonal decomposition, where we unravel the cyclical patterns in traffic, revealing underlying trends and seasonality. The traffic flow time series looks like:

The seasonal decomposition not only added depth to our analysis but also guided our feature engineering process, where we crafted meaningful variables to strengthen our predictive models.
